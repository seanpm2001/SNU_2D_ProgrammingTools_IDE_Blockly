// About:
// I decided to make JavaScript the main project language file for this project (SNU / 2D / Programming Tools / IDE / Blockly) as this is a Blockly IDE, and it needs its main languages to be represented here. Blockly is written in mostly JavaScript, while its projects are mostly written in JSON. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
